# Artificial Intelligence in the Arts

## Background:  
Advances in technology have always impacted the Arts.  Computers and the software developed for them have impacted both the visual and musical Arts since their creation and have been adopted by artists and the wider art world over time [link](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/artificial-intelligence-and-the-arts-toward-computational-creativity/). However, trends in artificial intellegence are beginning to challenge the concept that creativity and artistry are uniquely human.  Is artificial intelligence just another tool for creating that will be accepted over time, or will artificial intelligence threaten the future of artists and their livelihoods? Is AI good for the arts, or bad for the arts? 

## When AI in the Arts is a BAD THING:
- Large companies like Factory New in collaboration with Capitol records abusing their power through cultural appropriation and theft of intellectual property in developing musical avatars for consumption. Resource: NYT article on FN Meka: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/23/arts/music/fn-meka-dropped-capitol-records.html.
- In the avatar world using AI, a scenario is created where groups of people may be profiting off of the ethnic group an avatar represents without being part of that group themselves, as outlined by WAYE founder, a company that educates young people about technology, Sinead Bovell.  This is the case with both Factory New and Capitol records where white exectutive profit off of the FN Meka rapper's avatar. 
- Unregulated AI in the arts can undermine artists through exclusionary practices and uncompensated work.  In the case of FN Meka, rapper Kyle The Hooligan was initially consulted in the creation of FN Meka.  He provided lyrics as well as the voice for the character, but wasn't compensated for his work or his intellectual property: https://www.revolt.tv/article/2022-08-29/188979/kyle-the-hooligan-say-my-name-video/
- In the visual arts, new AI platforms such as DALL-E2, Midjourney and Stability Diffusion enable anyone to generate artwork by merely typing in a few terms, called prompts. Recently, an AI generated image won first place in a Colorado Fair which caused outrage: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html
- For some time, AI art generating developers  understood the potential that their algorithms could be used for harm (falsely representing political figures, disinformation, violence, gore, bias, rewriting and misrepresenting historical events) and made a commitment to remain private as a result.  Until recent AI companies began Beta testing publicly.  This has opened the floodgates of the good and the evil aspects of this software at a time when there is no oversight of the process. 
- AI companies have created enormous databases of scraped from the internet using images combined with the alt-text information and reveal the inclusion of content based on racism, sexism, pornography, violence and other eggregious content. Resource: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01963
- While some AI platforms are fed images that are in the public domain and source their "imagines" from Old Masters.  Perpetuation of exclusion happens when this is our only reference. In this case, while copyright isn't broken, the AI is drawing and learning from works that were created over time from a very small group, and it perpetuates the exclusion of women and people of color in the arts. Source: https://www.americanscientist.org/article/ai-is-blurring-the-definition-of-artist
- To date, women and BIPOC artists are still severely underrepresented in traditional Major US Galleries, art representation is still 85% white and 87% male, even with efforts being made to correct this.  These groups will continue to be marginalized with the use of AI relying on only a portion of art throughout history.  Resource: https://hyperallergic.com/501999/artists-in-18-major-us-museums-are-85-white-and-87-male-study-says/ 
- Using AI platforms, attempts to generate a “person” defaults to white and male. Whiteness is generated even when specifically searching for terms using dark skin.  Women are often distorted with extremely long necks, and default to young women. When trying to generate an older woman, it defaults to a woman of 80 years or older.  When searching for traditionally gendered roles, it will generate imagery that perpetuates gender bias, such as prompts for “doctor” returns males, and prompts for “nurse” return females, or worse, pornographic images of women in nurse outfits.  Resource: https://www.slaphappylarry.com/making-ai-art-with-midjourney/
- AI like Midjourney source any images over the past 100 years, current artists included who have developed an online presence as part of their livelihoods.  Their work is used to develop AI without knowledge, consent, compensation or recognition.  And then artists are invited to BETA test the AI software while being charged money for access and then contributing to additional AI learning at their expense. Resource: https://www.slaphappylarry.com/making-ai-art-with-midjourney/
- Artists don't have any way to opt in or opt out of being accessed by these AI companies. There are no regulations on labeling images for what prompts were used to make it or what software is used to create it when AI images are being consumed by the general public. Resource: https://waxy.org/2022/08/opening-the-pandoras-box-of-ai-art/
- Companies that have traditionally worked with artists to develop imagery will stop exploring collaborations with artists and go straight to AI companies that will scrape images off the internet to create composites within seconds and for free or very little cost to the companies. 
- What about copyright?  What about plagiarism?  Using this AI technology, you are scraping images and/or prompts from others without their permission, you have the capacity to claim those images as your own.  By using the technology, you also may not realize that your prompts and the image outputs are also being taken and used by others.  Resource: https://www.slaphappylarry.com/making-ai-art-with-midjourney/
- Environmentally, AI image processing demands an enormous amount of energy consumption to the extent where a person couldn't run this technology currently from a home computer.  As this technology advances, we will see issues arise around energy demands of this type of image generation. Resource: https://computingwithinlimits.org/2022/papers/limits22-final-Jaaskelainen.pdf


## When AI in the Arts is a GOOD THING:
Pros:
Pushback from Watchdogs (successful demands, social awareness), Social Backlash (pressure on companies to drop/apologize), Major Company Response (cancellation, apology)

Capitol drops AI rapper FN Meka after backlash (with quote from Industry Blackout): https://www.revolt.tv/article/2022-08-23/187992/capitol-records-drops-animated-rapper-fn-meka/

Pros:
helps to evolve how we see, respond to and consume art, allows for anyone to enter the art world (traditional and digital/new technologies),
Social media and watchdog organizations are able to keep major companies accountable, and help artists have a voice when they engage in racism/sexism/corrupt practices
Examples: 
-Industry Blackout's strong and effective response
-social media empowers humanity to play the role of watchdog against abuses of power from companies or individuals
-throughout history as technological advances developed in the arts, there has always been backlash (camera evolution (obscura, film, digital), photoshop, digital video editing software)
-don't hate the technology, hate the companies who cut artists out of the process or engage in racist/sexist/et al behaviors
